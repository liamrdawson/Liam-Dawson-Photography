# **PHOTOGRAPHY PORTFOLIO WEBSITE**

This is a static website that's been developed to showcase my street photography projects and to demonsrate skills in web development. You can visit the live version of the page [here](https://liamrdawson.com)


## Tech

This project was build using with:
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [JavaScript ES6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

And is transpiled through [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)


## Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the site in development mode. This uses ```webpack-dev-server``` to open the project on your default browsr and spin up a local sever (localhost:8080).

### `npm run build`

Builds the site for productoin to the ```dist``` folder, bundling the site and assets for the best performance.

The build is minified and filenames include hashes to avoid unnecessary caching.
